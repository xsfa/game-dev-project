# Checkpoint 1 - Project Proposal

## Elevator Pitch
Augmented reality iOS game where a user takes care of a plant, “feeding” it by studying for an uninterrupted time and completing small puzzles.

## Synopsis
Over the past few years, there has been a surge in apps available to help students and professionals focus on their work. Concurrently, augmented-reality apps went mainstream with games such as Pokemon GO and various utilities in the e-commerce and real-estate industries.

My game aims to blend these two worlds, giving the player the utility of a study timer with the immersive quality of augmented reality. 

In my game (name pending), the player is able to grow a plant in real-time as they study. This plant can show up on their desk via AR, giving the player instant feedback on their growth progress. 

On each time that the study timer ends, the player has the opportunity to solve a puzzle or trivia question. If the player solves it correctly, they receive a bonus to their plant growth or a random, fun attribute that the plant takes on. 

## Objective
The objective of the game is simple, grow your plant to be as big and bountiful as possible, and be able to see it in the real world. You accomplish this by studying for uninterrupted periods of time, and periodically completing small puzzles or trivia questions. 

## Overview of Mechanics
### Study Timer
Set a timer and don’t leave the app. Your plant will grow as the timer counts down

### Trivia/Puzzles
Have not finalized what kind of questions these will be. These questions will pop-up on each instance of the timer ending. Solving the question correctly will yield a bonus in how much your plants grows or what kind of attributes it takes on
